# WishList Member&trade;

WishList Member&trade; is the most comprehensive membership plugin for WordPress users. It allows you to create multiple membership levels, protect desired content and much more.

For more info please visit [member.wishlistproducts.com](https://member.wishlistproducts.com)

## Recommended System Requirements

- WordPress 5.0 or greater
- PHP version 7.3 or greater
- MySQL version 5.6 or greater

We recommend Apache or Nginx as the most robust and featureful server for running WishList Member.

_Note: If you are in a legacy environment where you only have older PHP or MySQL versions, WishList Member also works with PHP 5.6.20+ and MySQL 5.0+, but these versions have reached official End Of Life and as such may expose your site to security vulnerabilities._
